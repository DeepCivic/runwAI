"""Generate docs/security-report.md: where this repository stands against the ISM.

This is the artefact runwAI exists to produce. It answers "how does what I have built
compare to the ISM?" for someone who has never read the ISM and will not start now.

WHY IT LIVES HERE AND NOT IN .runwai/tools/

Decision 3 put runwAI's own self-checks in .runwai/tools/, because the template is not a
Python project and should not read as one. This is not one of those. The self-checks
validate runwAI's structure and an adopter loses nothing by deleting them; this generator
produces the thing an adopter adopted runwAI *for*. Putting it in .runwai/ would mean the
setup agent, following AGENTS.md, prunes the feature along with the record. It is CI
machinery, so it lives with the CI.

WHAT IT WILL NOT DO

  * Claim compliance. It reports which checks ran and what they found. Passing every check
    here means the code did not trip a set of automated tests, and nothing more.
  * Report a control as satisfied on no evidence. A control with nothing behind it renders
    as unassessed, never as implemented by default and never by omission.
  * Treat "not organisational" as "reachable". A control whose evidence lives in deployed
    infrastructure nobody declares in this repository is out of reach even though its
    surface is not organisational. That distinction is drawn explicitly below, because
    collapsing it is the most flattering lie this document could tell.
  * Fail the build. It exits 0 on any input it can read.

Usage:
    python3 .github/scripts/security_report.py [--repo-root PATH] [--findings FILE ...]
                                               [--scan-scope TEXT] [--out PATH]

Exit codes:
    0  written (the normal case, including when scanners produced nothing)
    2  could not run — a required input is missing or unreadable
