"""Audit the dependencies for known vulnerabilities, and write the bill of materials.

The checks beside this one read source files. They say nothing about the third-party
packages that source depends on, and a clean codebase sitting on a vulnerable dependency
is not secure — so a report that cannot tell those two apart is the kind of flattering
document this repository exists to refuse. This closes that gap for RWA-0031 (are the
imported components known-vulnerable?) and RWA-0032 (produce the SBOM and publish it).

WHAT MAKES THIS DETERMINISTIC

A CVE scanner is normally the least reproducible thing in a pipeline: the vulnerability
database moves under you, so the same lockfile can pass on Monday and fail on Tuesday with
no commit in between. That is not a verdict, it is a weather report.

So the database is an input here, not an ambient service. `--setup` downloads it once, into
a cache directory, and that is the only step that touches the network. Every scan after it
runs with `--skip-db-update --offline-scan` against exactly what was downloaded, and the
snapshot's own `UpdatedAt` is recorded in the output and in the report. Same lockfile plus
same database snapshot yields the same verdict, and when the verdict changes you can see
which of the two moved.

WHAT IT WILL NOT DO

  * Block. It is not on the commit hook and never should be — a CVE published overnight is
    not a reason a commit cannot be saved, and `.github/workflows/posture.yml` reports
    rather than gates. `make first-session` runs it without letting it abort the session.
  * Call a scan of nothing a pass. An ecosystem with no manifest in the tree reports `not
    applicable`, distinctly and by name. A check with no subject matter has found nothing,
    not nothing wrong.
  * Guess when it cannot run. A missing scanner or a missing database exits 2 and says what
    to install or which target to run, rather than reporting a clean tree.
  * Lose one control to the other's failure. The two legs are independent: the bill of
    materials (RWA-0032) needs syft alone, the vulnerability scan (RWA-0031) needs trivy
    and the database. A network that blocks the database still produces the SBOM, and the
    `scan` field in the JSON records which of the two actually ran, so a scan that never
    happened cannot read as a clean one.

Stdlib only; shells out to the pinned scanners. Their versions live in the Makefile, which
is where the install happens, so there is one source of truth for the pins.

Usage:
    python3 .github/scripts/audit.py --setup      # download the database (the networked step)
    python3 .github/scripts/audit.py              # scan offline, write the SBOM and the JSON

Exit codes, house convention:
    0  clean, or nothing to audit (`not applicable`)
    1  known vulnerabilities found
    2  could not run — a scanner or the database is missing (the output says which)
