"""Prove the security checks work — runwAI's verification receipts.

Answers one question for someone with no security background: do the checks this
repository claims to run actually catch what they claim to catch, right now, on this
machine? It proves it the only honest way — by showing them known-bad input:

  * every active rule fires on committed, deliberately vulnerable fixtures and stays
    silent on the safe ones beside them (semgrep --test over controls/tests/)
  * every rule has at least three vulnerable cases and one safe case, so a rule with
    no test cannot pass silently
  * a second run returns identical verdicts, which is determinism made checkable
  * the secret scanner catches a fake credential generated at run time, scanned the
    way the commit hook scans, and passes the clean file beside it

Every input is committed and pinned — the rules, the fixtures, the scanner versions —
so a tampered setup fails here visibly. What nothing here can do is force the checks
to run: `git commit --no-verify` walks past the hook, and nothing in this repository
blocks a merge. The output says so every time, whatever the verdict.

Stdlib only; shells out to the pinned scanners and reads their pins from
.pre-commit-config.yaml so there is one source of truth for versions.

Exit codes, house convention:
    0  everything verified
    1  a verification failed
    2  could not run — a scanner is missing (the output says what to install)
