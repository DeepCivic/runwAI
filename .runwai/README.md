# .runwai — the template's own record

**If you are building a project from this template, nothing in here is yours.** It is
runwAI's development record: how the template was built, what was decided while building
it, and what is left to do on it. Your project's decisions, backlog and contribution
process go in your own files.

Safe to delete. Nothing here is read by any gate, and removing it breaks nothing in your
project.

**Start with [`MAINTAINERS.md`](MAINTAINERS.md).** This file lists what is here; that one
explains what runwAI is for and which of its properties are load-bearing. Read it before
changing anything structural.

## Contents

| File | What it is |
| :--- | :--- |
| [`MAINTAINERS.md`](MAINTAINERS.md) | The maintainer's entry point: what the template is for, which properties are load-bearing, and the working rules — Do/Don't, boundaries, structure. `AGENTS.md` speaks only to the adopter, so maintainer sessions load this file deliberately |
| [`backlog.yaml`](backlog.yaml) | runwAI's outstanding work, structured. Stable IDs, referenced from commit messages. Closed items are deleted, not archived — the closing commit is the record |
| [`decisions.yaml`](decisions.yaml) | Decisions made while building the template. Distinct from `docs/setup.md`, which is the adopter's as-built record |
| [`provenance.md`](provenance.md) | Upstream repo, commit SHA and licence for every derived file |
| [`pinning.md`](pinning.md) | Verified tool pins, pending pins, how to complete one |
| [`contributing.md`](contributing.md) | How to contribute **to runwAI** — adding a check, provenance requirements |
| [`status.md`](status.md) | What is present, and what is honestly known about its limits |

## Why it is a dot-directory

Two reasons, and one cost.

Agents do not read it by default, so an adopter never pays context for runwAI's own
history. And a project built from this template will not be called runwAI — the licence,
the README and the project name all change on a template user's first commit — so the
material that belongs to *the template* has to be identifiable by location rather than by
name.

The cost: hidden directories rot quietly. `.runwai/tools/validate_helpers.py` checks the links in
here for that reason.

## Formats

`backlog.yaml` is structured data, not prose, because its readers are a maintainer and an
agent — neither needs a rendered version, and a second rendering would be one more thing
to keep in sync. Everything else here is Markdown because it is argument rather than data.
